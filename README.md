# K-Means-Clustering
You will implement the k-means clustering algorithm. You will use it to cluster a data set. For this assignment, we will use a data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Steps to run the code :
- dataFileName: It is the name of the data file to be clustered.
- k: An integer representing the number of clusters (three in the case of the iris data set).
- Iter: It is the number of iterations for the k-means clustering to run.
- initialPoints: It is the name of a file that contains a list of data points that are to be used as the starting centroids for each cluster.
